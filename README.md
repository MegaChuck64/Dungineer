## TODO
decouple graphics from game logic.
Lets just have a map, not worrying about sprite sizes or anything. 
Then we can easily swap out how the graphics are done. 
Can do all tile based collisions this way, etc. 

---

remove orth scene
remove old tilemap stuff and other unused stuff
do character select scene
think of a better way to handle control of map objects,
loading and stuff
we don't want to hardcode every tile
